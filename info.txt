    1. CDN: Use remote CDN links in your HTML file for CSS and JS. This method is not very customizable, but it is quick and simple. The links will looks like this
            <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-T3c6CoIi6uLrA9TneNEoa7RxnatzjcDSCmG1MXxSR1GAsXEV/Dwwykc2MPK8M2HN" crossorigin="anonymous">
            <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    2. Download Files: You can download the CSS and JS and include them locally instead of using remote links. this method is not very customizable but it is quick, simple and local.
    3. Compiled Saas: You can compile the Bootstrap Saas files on your own and customize the CSS that is built from them. You can download the Saas files or install using a package manager like NPM. This method is complicated but very customizable.
